a backwards compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older JavaScript engines.

Q4. How does Babel convert html code in React into valid code?
	Browsers don’t understand JSX out of the box, so most React users rely on a compiler like Babel or TypeScript to 
transform JSX code into regular JavaScript.

Q5. What is ReactDOM used for? Write an example?
	ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable 
an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page.

Q6. What are the packages that you need to import for react to work with?

	select folder
	npm start

Q7. How do you add react to a web application?
	Step 1: Add a DOM Container to the HTML
	Step 2: Add the Script Tags
	Step 3: Create a React Component

Q8. What is React.createElement?
	React. createElement( type, [props], [... children] ) Create and return a new React element of the given type. 
The type argument can be either a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span' ), a React component type (a class or a function), or a React fragment type.

Q9. What are the three properties that createElement accept?
	type, [props], [... children] 

Q10. What is the meaning of render and root?
	The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose 
value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

	The root node is the HTML element where you want to display the result. It is like a container for content managed by React.
